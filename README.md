# Spotify Guesser

This project is a React application built with TypeScript that integrates with the Spotify Web API, enabling you to play a music guessing game with your friends using Spotify's extensive music library. You could try a live demo at [spotiguess.jossafossa.nl](https://spotiguess.jossafossa.nl) if spotify would allow me to set the API in production mode. But unfortunately spotify requires you to have 250K active users ðŸŽ‰.
